        "description": "Hello Budapest, My name is Leo, Your Highness. We haven’t met yet, but I finally have arrived in Budapest and I would like to let you in some secrets about me, just to make sure you will recognize me when the time will come. I have a very strong feeling about you and me spending this summer together. So, who am I… I am coming from a large and highly sophisticated family, but if I am honest I was always the black sheep around. Nothing serious - of course, I mean from my part. :P I am eager to swim against the flow and to do what others may not even dream or think of trying. I love to travel, to get to know other cultures and people from all around the world. I love to eat…oh my God all those amazing flavors and colors of the world. If there’s food, there have to be drinks. Cocktails, wines, bubbles, champagne - I can handle them all, just make sure I have some friends around ;) Please reserve your table before arriving. Our kitchen is open till 10PM.Last call for drinks in the bar 11PM",
